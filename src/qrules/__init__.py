"""A rule based system that facilitates particle reaction analysis.

QRules generates allowed particle transitions from a set of conservation rules
and boundary conditions as specified by the user. The user boundary conditions
for a particle reaction problem are for example the initial state, final state,
and allowed interactions.

The core of `qrules` computes which transitions (represented by a
`.StateTransitionGraph`) are allowed between a certain initial and final state.
Internally, the system propagates the quantum numbers defined by the
`particle` module through the `.StateTransitionGraph`, while
satisfying the rules define by the :mod:`.conservation_rules` module. See
:doc:`/usage/reaction` and :doc:`/usage/particle`.

Finally, the `.io` module provides tools that can read and write the objects of
this framework.

    """Generate allowed transitions between an initial and final state.

    Serves as a facade to the `.StateTransitionManager` (see
    :doc:`/usage/reaction`).

    Arguments:
        initial_state (list): A list of particle names in the initial
            state. You can specify spin projections for these particles with a
            `tuple`, e.g. :code:`("J/psi(1S)", [-1, 0, +1])`. If spin
            projections are not specified, all projections are taken, so the
            example here would be equivalent to :code:`"J/psi(1S)"`.

        final_state (list): Same as :code:`initial_state`, but for final state
            particles.

        allowed_intermediate_particles (`list`, optional): A list of particle
            states that you want to allow as intermediate states. This helps
            (1) filter out resonances and (2) speed up computation time.

        allowed_interaction_types (`str`, optional): Interaction types you want
            to consider. For instance, both :code:`"strong and EM"` and
            :code:`["s", "em"]` results in `~.InteractionType.EM` and
            `~.InteractionType.STRONG`.

        formalism_type (`str`, optional): Formalism that you intend to use in
            the eventual amplitude model.

        particle_db (`.ParticleCollection`, optional): The particles that you
            want to be involved in the reaction. Uses `.load_pdg` by default.
            It's better to use a subset for larger reactions, because of
            the computation times. This argument is especially useful when you
            want to use your own particle definitions (see
            :doc:`/usage/particle`).

        mass_conservation_factor: Width factor that is taken into account for
            for the `.MassConservation` rule.

        max_angular_momentum: Maximum angular momentum over which to generate
            angular momenta.

        max_spin_magnitude: Maximum spin magnitude over which to generate
            spins.

        topology_building (str): Technique with which to build the `.Topology`
            instances. Allowed values are:

            - :code:`"isobar"`: Isobar model (each state decays into two states)
            - :code:`"nbody"`: Use one central node and connect initial and final
              states to it

        number_of_threads (int): Number of cores with which to compute the
            allowed transitions. Defaults to all cores on the system.

    An example (where, for illustrative purposes only, we specify all
    arguments) would be:

    >>> import qrules as q
    >>> result = q.generate_transitions(
    ...     initial_state="D0",
